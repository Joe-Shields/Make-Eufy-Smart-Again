# Make Eufy smart again!

Make a internet enabled IR controller for EUFY vacuum cleaners. Recent models of EUFY and Roomba vacuum cleaners include smartphone control, and my robot was feeling left out. So, lets make EUFY smart again!

## What you need: 

- EUFY vacuum cleaner: [non-internet models v11 and v11+](https://www.eufylife.com/collections/cleaning)
- ESP8266 based microcontroller: nodeMCU v0.9 used here, Adafruit Huzzah or any other internet enabled board can be used too
- Battery pack: Slimmer and bigger the better - current example uses a [12000 mAh battery charger](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B077N9KYV8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
